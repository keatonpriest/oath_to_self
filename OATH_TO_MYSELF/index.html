            As you return to your bunkers, feeling the isolation and depression, I want you to take 
            an oath. This is written in Anne Marie Beach, Florida where the Vitamin D and cool breeze 
            might do my talking. Also, I'm aware of the upcoming seasons that heavily drag your outlook 
            on life and output of work. However, you need to learn, grow, and fight.

            Others aren't standing in your everyday life to tell you about your intuitions, rather it takes a
            lifetime to find the people you call friends, family, and importantly community. You have no
            reiligious standing, serve no debt, hold no grudges, and remain no bad shape. In the cosmos of
            choas and entropy, a particular "tabula rasa" arose in you to choose any direction with a future
            tenderness. Yet, you decided to be an adventurer and community-builder.

            I'll restate the essitials to carve out this dream of yours is more than possibile, but a desire to
            learn, grow, and fight. I want you, ok? There the pitfalls for the people aren't fit. But you dance around
            around these like it's a gift. Believe your Pala. I love you.
